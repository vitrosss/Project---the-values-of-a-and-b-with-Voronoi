# Voronoi Seismic Parameter Mapping

This project focuses on the implementation of the Voronoi method to analyze seismic parameters in the form of a-values ​​and b-values ​​using earthquake data. This approach utilizes adaptive spatial partitioning through Voronoi diagrams to capture seismic heterogeneity at the local scale. In addition to the conventional Gutenberg–Richter model, this project also integrates the OK1993 magnitude distribution model (Ogata & Katsura, 1993) for log-likelihood-based estimation of β, μ, and σ parameters.
